# PIZZApizza
Mimic a pizza making procedure, by writing codethat prints statements in a specific order

Started preparing pizza ...
Made the base
Added the sauce and cheese
Added the pizza toppings
Cooked the pizza
Pizza is ready

Task 1: Create 6 JS functions which print the pizza processing
statements and call those functions in sequence. Use a mix of
function declarations, expressions and arrow functions.

Task 2: Make the functions asynchronous by using setTimeout with
different time durations, maintaining the right order.

Task 3: Modify the asynchronous functions to use Promises and
achieve the required result.

Task 4: Modify the functions to use async/await and achieve the
required result.



BUT ----  THIS VERSION HAS SPINNING PIZZA

---------------------

create a html card to display an img and some text,  used css to animate the img card to rotate 360 degrees 
and style to text to be larger 20px; 
droped the js code i had writen for the console into an external sheet, and made a async  infinit while (true) loop 

and a reset card function to reset the card back to the start "first card"
used "await" to make a message then added the img to the ned of the message. delayed it by x time in ms and repeted this for each messasage. 


then call the functions in the order prescribed
